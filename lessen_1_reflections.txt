How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me compare and correct the code and get the code working.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can get back to the older version of code any time and can get useful
    information for it,

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - Commit is in hands of user.
    cons - If commit is not done for longer time version may get lost.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because these files are linked to each other in some or the other way like in
    project with multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log to go through the commits and git diff to compare two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Using version control makes me more confident to make changes that could break
    something because if that happens i can get back to previous version any time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Work on my projects with git
